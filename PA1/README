 <DESCRIPTION>
	This program is trying to simulate the RISC-V for
	a single instruction execution. The function 
	“single_instrcution_execution()” will be called 
	periodically by the given main function. With the 
	given pc address, the program can read and execute 
	the instruction, and finally return the expected 
	value back to the memory or register. 
<NOTES>  
	Some of the sub-functions are still not tested.
<TEST PLANS> 
	Since the program is written in multiple sub-functions,
	we will test the sub-functions by the programmer 
	individually with the binary 32-bit instruction. 
	The program should make sure that all the sub-functions 
	should work perfectly with the whole program. Then merge 
	them, and push it to the gitlab. After completing coding 
	and testing the whole program, we will run a test file.
