<DESCRIPTION>
	This program is trying to implement virtual memory. We tried
	to implement the caches which would be indexed by a combination
	of virtual and physical address. So, two TLBs are needed, one
	is instruction TLB and one is data TLB.
	Moreover than that, we also tried to fix bugs for PA3.

<NOTES>  
	The execute_one.c in the 'master' directory (NOT PA1, PA2 nor PA3)
	is the file for this assignment, which is PA4.
	
<TEST PLANS> 
	As we did before, we test every sub-funtion again in the execution
	stage and try to make sure they can run correctly. To do this, we
	used the website the prof. provided to generate an assembly binary
	instruction code specificly for each funtion.
	Except for some strange functions like auipc, we couldn't fix that
	due to time lackness.
	Next, we test stalls, forwarding, static branch prediction, I-cache
	and D-cache with different circumastances for different functions.
	Because of the complexity of our code, do this testing is hard and
	we just combine them with the new test for PA4. If everything goes
	beyound what we expect. We will stop and fix that.
	As indicated above, we do the testing for the entire program after
	finishing code.
	No further details of testing---
