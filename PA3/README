<DESCRIPTION>
	This program is trying to implement two caches, I-cache
	and D-cache.
	Also, finish the implementation of BTB for PA2.

<NOTES>  
	The execute_one.c in the 'master' directory (NOT PA1 or PA2)
	is the file for this assignment, which is PA3.
	We didn't fix the bugs for I-cache that cannot get the next
	four instructions from the memory for unseen reasons.

<TEST PLANS> 
	The same as the PA1 and PA2, we will do the testing for each
	command in each stage. And after finish coding the whole 
	program, we will run a big test.
	Actually, we didn't finish the test.
