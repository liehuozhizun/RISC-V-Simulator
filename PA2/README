 <DESCRIPTION>
	This program is trying to simulate the RISC-V in five 
	stages of pipeline. The five stages will pass the data
	by the specific stage registers. At the same time, this 
	program will implement stalls and BTB in advanced.
<NOTES>  
	
<TEST PLANS> 
	The same as the PA1, we will do the testing for each stage.
	And after finish coding the whole program, we will run a 
	big test.
